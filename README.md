# :space_invader: WASM Gate

WASM Gate is a wrapper for creating/running [Extism](https://extism.org) plugins (or just programs) which is based on
[Wazero](https://wazero.io) zero dependency WASM runtime for Go.

The main goal of this project is to provide a simple way to create and run WASM modules with very flexible policy based
access to host resources with additional host functions for different use-cases.
